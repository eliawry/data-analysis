This here is a data analysis structure. Maintaining your analysis in one
of these instead of some insane haphazard pile of ideas might be a good 
idea. There's even READMEs in every subdirectory. But, um, that's actually
because it's kind of annoying to make git commit an empty subdirectory.
It really doesn't want to, unless you add a .gitignore. But then I figured
the more documentation the better, right?

Anyway, the idea is to fork this everytime a new project starts.
